## Requirements 

1. **HTML Structure**: 

   - Create a form with fields for: 

     - Name 

     - Email 

     - Password 

   - Include a submit button. 

   - Add placeholders and `required` attributes for the input fields. 

  

2. **JavaScript Code**: 

   - Validate each input field: 

     - **Name**: Should not be empty. 

     - **Email**: Should be in a valid email format. 

     - **Password**: Should be at least 8 characters long. 

   - Use event listeners for real-time validation on `input` and `blur` events. 

   - Display appropriate error messages for invalid input. 

   - Remove error messages once the input is corrected. 

  

3. **Error Messages**: 

   - Display error messages below each input field when invalid. 

   - Error messages should disappear once the input is corrected. 

  

## Usage 

1. Clone this repository: 

   ```bash 

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/form-validation-assignment.git 

   ``` 

2. Navigate to the project directory: 

   ```bash

   ``` 

3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the form and interact with it. 

  

## Technologies Used 

- HTML 

- CSS 

- JavaScript 

  

## File Structure 

``` 

form-validation-assignment/ 

├── index.html        # Main HTML file containing the form 

├── styles.css        # CSS file for styling the form and error messages 

└── script.js         # JavaScript file for form validation logic 

``` 

  

## Screenshots 

*(Include screenshots of the form in action, displaying error messages when invalid inputs are provided, and the successful submission message.)* 

  

## Conclusion 

This assignment demonstrates the ability to create a functional form with real-time input validation. By utilizing JavaScript event listeners, we ensure users receive immediate feedback on their input, enhancing the user experience. Error messages guide users to correct their inputs before form submission, ensuring data integrity.
